        <h4>Our Spiritual Precept</h4>
        <p>Here at the spiritual threshold, we turn no one away who is in need. No cleansing job is beyond our highly sought 
          skills. However we are a for-profit concern and reserve the right to divert non-paying customers to less well-travelled
          spiritual paths. No humans. Gold in hand accepted.</p>

          <p>The maids are hard workers, whose names have been taken by Yubaba so that they are forever in her
          power. The bath house could not run without their skill and numbers.</p>

          <p><strong>Kamaji</strong> the boiler man is at the heart of the bath house, supplying heat, water, and bath additives
